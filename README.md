To play with hitstar:
1. Go to anyfolder.
2. Right-click on the three dots at the top-right and copy perma-link.
3. Go to Hitstar app
4. Go to settings and change Online Path to the copied link and erase the folder name at the end of the link.
   It should look like this "https://github.com/JunichiAmano/personal-hitster/c28cd412c162784005117b917d0181a31443d73b/"
   The last part changes everytime the github has a change.
