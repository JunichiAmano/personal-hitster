To play with hitstar:
1. Go to any folder.
2. Right-click on the three dots at the top-right and copy perma-link.\
   It should look like this:
    >https://github.com/JunichiAmano/personal-hitster/tree/a3a66e12024107c402690eada69c05a34fd562b5/try0
4. Keep only whats between tree/ and the folder name. This is the id of the last commitment in this repository. In this example:
    >a3a66e12024107c402690eada69c05a34fd562b5/
6. Paste the id after the following link:
    >https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunichiAmano/personal-hitster/
8. Go to Hitstar app
9. Go to settings and change Online Path to the copied link and erase the folder name at the end of the link.\
   It should look like this
    >https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunichiAmano/personal-hitster/a3a66e12024107c402690eada69c05a34fd562b5/
   The last part changes everytime the github has a change.
